## Why This Project?

Since I started my career in the cloud in 2009, I've been asked on many occasions to compare services from different public or private cloud providers. All those years, I've kept notes in my OneNote but keeping track of the growing cloud landscape is by no means a one-person job, hence I decided to publish this on GitHub for several reasons:

1. First, I am sure other people have also been asked to compare AWS to Azure to Google Cloud. This will give them a simple reference they can go to and find a solid starting point

2. Second, I teach Cloud Computing in a local college and would like to use this information for illustration purposes for my students as well as give them a good base they can build on

3. Last, but not least, I hope that by making this information public, others will be willing to contribute, improve and enrich thir reference

## Mindmaps

The [mindmaps](https://github.com/CrimsonPinnacle/cloud-landscape/tree/master/mindmaps) folder contains different mindmaps of the cloud vendors, services, tools and projects in a well categorized view. The mindmaps are developed using [Novamind](https://www.novamind.com) but are also exported in PDF format for easy viewing.

Here is a list of the currently available mindmaps:
